# MechMania 26 Python Starter Pack
![MechMania 26 Logo](https://mechmania.io/images/MM26LOGO.png)

Welcome to MechMania 26! This is the **Python Starter Pack**. In this repository is the base code to help you get started with the competition.

## The Don'ts
- **Don't** edit any files except for `strategy.py`. These other files are necessary for your code to interface with the engine. Messing with them will only cause your player to function incorrectly!
- **Don't** change the return type of `make_decision` in `strategy.py`. Again, if you do, you'll only be hurting yourself.

## The Do's
- **Do** implement your strategy in `strategy.py`. This file is used by the rest of our code to send your decision to the game engine. Make sure you return a `CharacterDecision` object.
- **Do** use the helper functions in `API.py` to assist you in implementing your strategy. You can always write your own additional helper functions as well, although we recommend not putting them in `API.py`.
- **Do** create new files to help organize your code as you wish!
- **Do** use the objects defined in the `engine` folder to help you.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the classes and functions given to you here, please check out the [game wiki](https://github.com/jackducham/mm26-design/wiki) or ask the MechMania staff on our Discord. Good luck!
